# Write a UI Component Test

1. The `<Contact />` component displays an expandable contact card.
   Clicking on the title shows or hides contact details.
   Import this component (and its dependency, `<Address />`)
   into your app, and try it out in the browser.

2. We need a test for this component though!

   To do this, first list on paper the criteria for passing
   the test. What needs to be rendered when?

3. Now write a test that verifies this component works
   correctly.

## Stretch Task

For an extra challenge, write a test for the `<TweetBox />`
component.
